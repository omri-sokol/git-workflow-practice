Interesting website:
https://techcrunch.com/

The reason I find this website interesting is because it provides its user with a lot of information about new and upcoming startups in the tech world. Everyday new and upcoming startups are emerging in the world and each of them have new technologies that they bring into the world. Tech crunch informs its users about all of these new technologies and startups that emerge. They also have different sections for different types of technologies like fintech, AI, space tech, etc. Tech crunch has content for a diverse audience which is why I reccomend it to many people.
